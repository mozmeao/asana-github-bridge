# Github-Asana Bridge

Github Actions integration with Asana

*Status:* WIP/pre-production - unstable, incomplete and **not for general use**.

This repo enables Github Action integration with Asana in ways that are
suited to the MozMEAO workflow.

## Example usage

1. Set up your repo's secrets to make `ASANA_PAT` and `ASANA_PROJECT` available - both of these you get from the Asana side. Ideally, the PAT should be an Asana [service account](https://asana.com/guide/help/premium/service-accounts) token.

2. Ideally using a service account, create a Githib Personal Access Token (eg called `ASANA_GITHUB_BRIDGE_TOKEN`) with these permissions:
    * `read: org` - to see organization membership and team membership.
    * `admin: write` - to be able to comment on the original Issue

    If you are using SSO remember to authorize that token for access.

3. In `your-project/.github/workflows/choose-a-filename.yaml` add:

```code:yaml

name: "Github-Asana bridge"

on:
  issues:
    types:
      - opened

jobs:
  handle_issue:
    name: "Trigger following GH Issue creation"
    uses: mozmeao/asana-github-bridge/.github/workflows/issue_handler.yaml@APPROPRIATE_VERISON_HERE
    with:
      only-react-to: repo-org   #Â optional - see issue_handler.yaml
    secrets:
      ASANA_PAT: ${{ secrets.ASANA_PAT }}
      ASANA_PROJECT: ${{ secrets.ASANA_PROJECT }}
      REPO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ASANA_GITHUB_BRIDGE_TOKEN }}
```

More information will follow as functionality is checked and enabled.
